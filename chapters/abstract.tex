\chapter*{Abstract}

Recent breakthroughs in machine intelligence, such as AlphaZero or ChatGPT, have proven that Reinforcement Learning can be used successfully to solve complex sequential decision problems with super-human performance level. However, despite the successful applications that use function approximation techniques, one key challenge for RL algorithms is data efficiency. In this line, hierarchical methods have been historically utilised for simplyfying the solutions. The philosiphycal motivation in favor of hierarchical systems is several-fold. First, human tend to think and reason at different levels of abstractions. Second, solving several smaller problem could be easier and more straightforward than solving the original problem. And third, decomposing a problem into subtasks or skills allows agents to exploit composability properties of different methods.

We present three different frameworks in which agent can exploit compositionality. Instead of applu
